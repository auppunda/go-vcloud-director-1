## IMPORTANT

To help us process your pull request efficiently, please follow the 
guidelines shown below. 

## A Pull Request should be associated with an Issue

We wish to have discussions in Issues. A single issue may be targeted by multiple PRs.
If you're offering a new feature or fixing anything, we'd like to know beforehand in Issues,
and potentially we'll be able to point development in a particular direction.

We accept PRs without associated issues provided the change is sufficiently evident 
from the commit message. If you have typos or simple bug fixes go for it.

## Description

- (Required) Short description of changes in the PR subject

- (Required) Detailed description of changes include tests and
  documentation. If the pull request contains multiple commits with 
  detailed messages, refer to those instead
